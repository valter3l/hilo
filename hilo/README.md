# HiLo
Are you a good guesser? Hilo is a game in which the player guesses if the next card drawn by the dealer will be higher or lower than the previous one. Points are won or lost based on whether or not the player guessed correctly.
It is simple to play.

**RULES**
* The player starts the game with 300 points.
* Individual cards are represented as a number from 1 to 13.
* The current card will be displayed.
* The player guesses if the next one will be higher or lower.
* If the player guessed correctly earns 100 points.
* If incorrectly, the player loses 75 points.
* The game is over if the player reaches 0 points.
* While a player has more than 0 points he can decide if he wants to keep playing.
* The game can be over when the player decides to.
